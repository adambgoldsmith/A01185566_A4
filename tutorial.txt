 Type 1, 2, 3, 4, north, south, east, west to move in a direction.

 If you encounter a chest puzzle or a nymph riddle, use the NUMBERS ONLY to answer (1, 2, 3, 4).

 Nymphs and chests will disappear after you have attempted to solve them.

 Shops are persistent on the board. If you find a shop, remember what tile it was on for later!

 Battling is turn based. Checking your inventory is the only option that does not count as a valid move.
 If you attempt to use an item/ability without resources or attempt to flee, it will still count as a move.

 The bosses can get very difficult if you are not prepared! Make sure to explore the WHOLE map
 and stock up on resources and levels before fighting each boss!

 Good luck, Captain!
