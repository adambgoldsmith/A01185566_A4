### About
Nimbus Voyage is a fantasy airship rpg game that was created in python and played on the command-line.
Nimbus Voyage was created as an assignment for class 1510 at BCIT CST.

### How to install:
1.

### How to play:
 Type 1, 2, 3, 4, north, south, east, west to move in desired direction.

 If you encounter a chest puzzle or a nymph riddle, answer using numbers only (1, 2, 3, 4).

 Nymphs and chests will disappear after you have attempted to solve them.

 Shops are persistent on the board. If you find a shop, remember what tile it was on for later!

 Battling is turn based. Checking your inventory is the only option that does not count as a valid move.
 If you attempt to use an item/ability without resources or attempt to flee, it WILL count as a move.

 Bosses are located in the bottom right corner of each map. Killing a boss will advance you to the next region.

 The bosses can get very difficult if you are not prepared! Make sure to explore the WHOLE map
 and stock up on resources and levels before taking on the region boss!

 Good luck, Captain!
